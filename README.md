# Path Finder

This project is a Path Finder application implemented in Java, utilizing Java Swing, Applet, Open GL, and Google Maps libraries. The application allows users to select a starting and ending point on a map and visualize the shortest path between the two locations. It utilizes various graph algorithms, including BFS, Dijkstra, and A*, to find the optimal path.

## Features

The Path Finder application includes the following key features:

- **Map Selection**: Users can select a map or provide a custom map to define the environment for path finding. The map can include obstacles, terrain features, or any other elements that affect the path.

- **Starting and Ending Points**: Users can specify the starting and ending points or locations on the map between which they want to find the shortest path.

- **Graph Algorithms**: The application offers different graph algorithms, including BFS, Dijkstra, and A*, to find the optimal path between the starting and ending points. Users can choose the algorithm that best suits their needs.

- **Visualization**: The application provides visual representation of the path finding process, allowing users to see how the algorithm explores different paths and determines the shortest route. This visualization enhances understanding and insight into the path finding process.

## Dependencies

This project relies on the following dependencies:

- **Language**: Java
- **GUI Libraries**: Java Swing, Applet
- **Mapping Libraries**: Open GL, Google Maps

Ensure that you have the necessary libraries installed and properly configured to run the Path Finder application.

## Usage

To use the Path Finder application, follow these steps:

1. Install Java on your system if it is not already installed.

2. Compile and run the Java source files.

3. Ensure that the required dependencies, including Java Swing, Applet, Open GL, and Google Maps libraries, are available and properly configured.

4. Launch the application and select a map or provide a custom map with obstacles or terrain features.

5. Specify the starting and ending points or locations on the map between which you want to find the shortest path.

6. Choose the graph algorithm (BFS, Dijkstra, or A*) that you want to use for path finding.

7. Initiate the path finding process and observe the visualization of how the algorithm explores different paths to determine the shortest route.

8. The application will display the shortest path between the starting and ending points, along with any obstacles or terrain features encountered along the way.

Feel free to experiment with different maps, starting and ending points, and graph algorithms to find the optimal path in different scenarios.

## Future Enhancements

While the current version of the Path Finder application provides essential functionality, there are several areas that can be improved in future updates:

- **Additional Algorithms**: Expand the range of graph algorithms available for path finding to offer more options and cater to different scenarios.

- **Advanced Visualization**: Enhance the visualization capabilities to provide more detailed and interactive representations of the path finding process, allowing users to adjust visualization speed or explore different stages of the algorithm.

- **Obstacle Avoidance**: Implement obstacle avoidance techniques within the algorithms to find alternative paths when obstacles are encountered, ensuring a more flexible and adaptive path finding process.

- **Real-time Updates**: Enable real-time updates of the map or environment, allowing users to modify the terrain or add new obstacles dynamically and observe the impact on the path finding process.

- **User Preferences**: Provide options for users to customize the application's settings, such as map styles, graph algorithm parameters, or visualization preferences.
